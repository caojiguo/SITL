# Computing codes for replicating the simulation studies in the manuscript entitled "Similarity-Informed Transfer Learning for  Survival Time with Functional Covariates". 
    
It contains two R files:

1. Sim1.R : In this file, we give the R code of the coefficient estimation and explore the performance of the proposed estimators.

2. Sim2.R : In this file, we give the R code of the confidence interval constructions. In this code, we show the performance of our model inference.
